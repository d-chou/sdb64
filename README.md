SD, the Multivalue String Database

SD is based on the GPL Version of OpenQM v2.6.6, released in 2007 by Ladybridge Systems.

ScarletDME is a 32 and 64 bit fork of the original OpenQM database maintained by Greg Buckle

SD is 64 bit only and runs only on Linux.  Releases are tested on the most current release
of Linux Mint LMDE (Debian based).  It should run on any Ubuntu flavor 22.04 or later, and 
probably on other distros derived from Debian 12 orfrom Ubuntu 22.04 or later. Other distros, YMMV.

The current release snapshot can be found on PCloud.

As far as I can tell, SD will cohabit peacefully with existing QM and ScarletDME installations as
it is installed to a different location and uses memory offsets not used by OpenQM or ScarletDME.

See the sd64/sdsys/changelog file for changes in each version release.
