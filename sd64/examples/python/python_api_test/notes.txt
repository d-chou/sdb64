  Very minimal test program for sdclilib.
   
  Upper Memo will display responses and status codes, lower Memo is used for read / write actions.
  
  Enter Address, User Name, Password and Account (next to login button) in associated fields, click login to connect.
  
  You will hopefully see something like:
  
    Attempting to connect
    Connection stat: 1
    Connected

  In the upper memo.

  Enter a known file name in the field next to the Open button (in my test case the file name is TESTDATA).
  Click the Open button.
   
  Response in the upper memo:
  
	Open successful: TESTDATA FileNbr: 1
	
  Note: Open populates the File Number file for both the Close and Read / Write test.
  
  Enter a known Record Id in the field Record Id and click Read.
  
  Response in upper memo is a bunch of debug info, Response in lower memo should be the actual record with field markers converted to line endings.
  
  Using the lower memo change the record, and click Write.
  
  The record should be updated, verify via terminal logged into sd.

  The Execute button will execute the command selected from the drop down list.
  
  Response should show up in upper memo.
  
  The Call button test callx, and GetArg by executing the BASIC subroutine found in BP TESTSUB, code below.
  This subroutine must be compiled and cataloged in the account.
  
  Response in upper memo:
  
    Attempt to call TEST
    Attempt retrieve arg 2
    arg 2: and arg2 Plus we added TIMEDATE 09:30:55 19 DEC 2023

  BP TESTSUB 
 
 * very simple test of QMCallx
 *  open TESTDATA
 *  create a record made up of passed values
 *  add a field with a time date stamp
 *  write the record as TESTSUB
 *  return the field with the time date stamp to the caller
 01: subroutine TESTSUB(a1, a2, a3)
 02: open 'TESTDATA' to TS ELSE ABORT
 03: a2rtn = a2:  ' Plus we added TIMEDATE ':TIMEDATE()
 04: rec = ''
 05: rec = a1
 06: rec<2> = a2
 07: rec<3> = a3
 08: rec<4> = a2rtn
 09: write rec on TS, "TESTSUB"
 10: a2 = a2rtn
 11: Return
 12: End
